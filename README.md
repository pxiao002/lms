# Labor Management Systems Implementation @ DHL Supply Chain
Design to showcase our input in Labor Management Systems Implementation. With sensitive data removed. 

## What is LMS (Labor Management System)?

A labor management system is a software solution designed to manage human labor within a warehouse or distribution center. By compiling employee data throughout the day, a labor management system is able to report productivity levels on a group of employees or individuals, allowing managers and executives to see where their labor dollars are spent and optimize their human assets.

## What Are the Benefits of a Labor Management System?

- **Critical data collection & reporting** – A labor management system collects and reports performance data to monitor progress on set goals and objectives.
- **Increasing employee satisfaction** – Employee satisfaction improvements stem from fair performance targets, coaching and incentive programs.
- **Productivity improvements and labor savings** – Managers are enabled to identify and adjust inefficient work processes. Thus allowing them to optimize their workers and reduce overall labor costs.
- **Improved management decisions** – A labor management system provides real-time insights that enables management to reallocate work, transfer resources and manage costs in a timely manner.
- **Improved customer satisfaction** – By collecting and making sense of data, labor management systems are able to better forecast and predict assignment completion so that customers receive their orders on time.
